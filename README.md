# Dissertation

This project was created for my Dissertation assignment. The program simulates a market in which parties that are willing to sell off
their unused cloud-computing resources to the highest bidder. At the same time these bidders bid for the Jobs that are marketed by
these parties.

The program uses an implementation of the stable marriage algorithm to solve the problem of what buyers should be matched with what
sellers.

In order to show the workings of the algorithm, a gui was created that lets users interact with the code and run simulations to see how
the programatic logic handles different scenario's.
